# Journey_to_Microsoft_Office

I am following Pluralsight's "Using Microsoft Office 2016, because my work starts heavily replies on that. 35 hours of content. So, let the learning begin!

So what's new:    
* Word 2016 has some new chart, and co-authoring    
* Excel has new chart, including pivot table, self help searchbar, history, etc.    
* Powerpoint has co-authoring, create video, new charts, share with others, history    
* One note is a notetaking application, clipper
* Outlook: clutter, group
* Access: ?
* Visio: fragment is new to me

MY: Office is so business-y, professional, monolith, detail orientation required

MY: Ok, I will only learn Word, Excel and Powerpoint

MY: Ok, I don't have much experience in Microsoft Project

## New Course: Word 

## New Course: Excel
MY: Advanced Filter is kind of cool and new to me. It copy and paste a table based on certain criteria

CL: Select a whole row is ctrl+space

Topics: 
* table
* find and replace
* sum and autosum 
* Column and row width
* print
* (Advanced) conditional formating
* (Advanced) Formula 
* (Advanced) Table: filter, sort

MY: makes me wonder if I can code something like excel on the web in whatever technology

(tip): select current cell shortcut: F2

MY: now I basically know how to match two tables and find missing and new and change rows

(new method)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44553175/excel-finding-difference-in-two-lists]

(tip): view all formula on the sheet shortcut: ctrl+`

(tip): select a selection to the end by ctr+shift+end, type tab to go back to the top

(tip) making into a table will make the column name stays when scroll down

(tip): ctrl+; to get today's date
