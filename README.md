# Journey_to_Microsoft_Office

I am following Pluralsight's "Using Microsoft Office 2016, because my work starts heavily replies on that. 35 hours of content. So, let the learning begin!

So what's new:    
* Word 2016 has some new chart, and co-authoring    
* Excel has new chart, including pivot table, self help searchbar, history, etc.    
* Powerpoint has co-authoring, create video, new charts, share with others, history    
* One note is a notetaking application, clipper
* Outlook: clutter, group
* Access: ?
* Visio: fragment is new to me

MY: Office is so business-y, professional, monolith, detail orientation required

MY: Ok, I will only learn Word, Excel and Powerpoint

MY: Ok, I don't have much experience in Microsoft Project
